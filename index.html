        <p>The central nexus of all things MissMostlyGhostly, Will, or Willow Phillips.
          Here you can find my current works in progress, my blog (down below from the Wordpress image) and much more. 
          Look around, find something to ask me about in the Contact section, or meander over to About Will to learn more about 
          me and about what I'm currently working towards.</p>

       <h2>Some Tidbits About What I Can Do</h2><br>
       <ul id="tidbits">
         <li><b>• Creative, Eye-Catching Website Design</b></li> <br>
          <p>Need a website that suits your individual, stunning brand? I have the skills you need to make something viewers will enjoy interacting with.
             Have a certain look in mind? I understand that your website is, in so many cases, the very first impression customers will get.
             With that in mind, every paragraph and each image will be aimed at drawing attention and interest. 
          </p> <br>
        <li><b>• Social Media Management</b></li> <br>
           <p>Need a Web Developer who knows how to talk to customers? Someone who understands the importance of brand management? Keeping
              social media platforms up-to-date and engaging is too much to handle for a business owner who already has enough on their plate.
              With the understanding of your brand and the image you want to project to the world, I can manage social media accounts and regular 
              posting to keep engagement.
           </p>
        <br>
        <li><b>• Knowledge of Keyword-Based Content Writing</b></li> <br>
          <p>Although coding is my strong suit, easily my second-best skill is content writing. I have a degree in 
            English Literature and Language, which I love to utilize when writing engaging blurbs for websites and social media. I love to do casual research to prove my aptitude, 
            send me your website and tell me a bit about your brand and I can get back to you with an example of my work.</p>
