  <p>Welcome to my "About" page! I'm a writer, developer, and all-around Internet savvy 21-year-old from San Diego, California. I have an AA in English 
    Literature and Language, and I'm in the process of accumulating various accreditations in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>I started my formal education in college, because I was homeschooled up until that point. My family was dysfunctional to say the least, so as a 
    result any and all education that happened after age 9 was learning I did of my own volition, without support or supervision. Just middle-school-
    age me spending countless hours on the computer doing online courses and comparing my educational level to other kids my age. This has 
    lead to the drive and persistance it has taken to learn the skills I now possess, skills that let me code websites from scratch.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>My dream is a relatively humble one: To be a productive and supportive member of a development team (or a single developer for a smaller company) 
    remotely, so I can explore the world if I so desire but also so I can have the toolset to create amazing websites, awe-inspiring works of art. 
    I ask for the oppertunity to show you (and the Wide Web) how much my drive, determination, 
    and strength of character can achieve.
  </p>
