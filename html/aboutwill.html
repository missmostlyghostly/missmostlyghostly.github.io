        <p>My name is Willow (Will) Phillips, and I'm a San Diego based developer who revels in the creation of new projects and in working 
          with new and exciting brands. Surrounded by natural talent so close to LA, I've been encouraged by the brillaince of others to 
          pursue my passion, which is web development. I make websites, manage them, 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Other than my inclination for making websites, I love volunteering with the youth in my community and making projects using half 
          a dozen art forms (chiptune, pixel art, origami) I've never used before. At the moment, I'm writing a short horror story in tadem 
          with coding a little pixel game to go along with it. From the music to the sound effects, to the art to the code, I'm learning them 
          all at a base level to create something entirely on my own. 
          </p>
          <br>
        <p>At the moment, I'm spending all my free time and spare time trying to break into the Web Development field. I'm writing websites from scratch, 
          I'm speaking with local artists and hopeful streamers about making a website to both showcase their skills and mine.
